-Cryptovirology: cryptolocker

When analyzing a binary program, researches must manually identify the cryptographic algorithm.  By automating this, they will be able to complete this task more quickly, enabling a faster response to malware and other threats.

Previous work in this area relies on heuristics to identify cryptographic primitives in the binary
